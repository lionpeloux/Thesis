Benvenuto 1991 : The battle between weight and rigidity constitutes, in itself, the single aesthetic theme of art in architecture: and to bring out this conflict in the most varied and clearest way is its office. Architecture accomplishes such a task, barring the direct route of free expansion to those indestructible forces, slowing them up by deflecting them; thus the battle continues and shows, in manifold forms, the unceasing efforts of the two opposing forces.
