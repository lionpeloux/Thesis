abstract = {Twist and writhe measure basic geometric properties of a ribbon or tube. While these measures have applications in molecular biology, materials science, fluid mechanics and astrophysics, they are under-utilized because they are often considered difficult to compute. In addition, many applications involve curves with endpoints (open curves); but for these curves the definition of writhe can be ambiguous. This paper provides simple expressions for the writhe of closed curves, and provides a new definition of writhe for open curves. The open curve definition is especially appropriate when the curve is anchored at endpoints on a plane or stretches between two parallel planes. This definition can be especially useful for magnetic flux tubes in the solar atmosphere, and for isotropic rods with ends fixed to a plane.},

Our derivation emphasizes space-time sym- metry, which sheds light on the role of time-parallel transport in eliminating—without approximation—all but an O(n) band of en- tries of the physical system’s energy Hessian. The result is a fast, unified, implicit treatment of viscous threads and elastic rods that closely reproduces a variety of fascinating physical phenomena, in- cluding hysteretic transitions between coiling regimes, competition between surface tension and gravity, and the first numerical fluid- mechanical sewing machine. The novel implicit treatment also yields an order of magnitude speedup in our elastic rod dynamics.},

Our approach differs from existing simulation techniques in the graphics and mechanics lit- erature both in the kinematic description—we represent the mate- rial frame by its angular deviation from the natural Bishop frame— as well as in the dynamical treatment—we treat the centerline as dynamic and the material frame as quasistatic. Additionally, we describe a manifold projection method for coupling rods to rigid- bodies and simultaneously enforcing rod inextensibility. The use of quasistatics and constraints provides an efficient treatment for stiff twisting and stretching modes; at the same time, we retain the dy- namic bending of the centerline and accurately reproduce the cou- pling between bending and twisting modes. We validate the discrete rod model via quantitative buckling, stability, and coupled-mode experiments, and via qualitative knot-tying comparisons.},

abstract = {Piecewise clothoids are 2D curves with continuous, piecewise linear curvature. Due to their smoothness properties, they have been extensively used in road design and robot path planning, as well as for the compact representation of hand-drawn curves. In this paper we present the Super-Clothoid model, a new mechanical model that for the first time allows for the computing of the dynamics of an elastic, inextensible piecewise clothoid. We first show that the kinematics of this model can be computed analytically depending on the Fresnel integrals, and precisely evaluated when required. Secondly, the discrete dynamics, naturally emerging from the Lagrange equations of motion, can be robustly and efficiently computed by performing and storing formal computations as far as possible, recoursing to numerical evaluation only when assembling the linear system to be solved at each time step. As a result, simulations turn out to be both interactive and stable, even for large displacements of the rod. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our model by handling various boundary conditions for the rod as well as complex external constraints such as frictional contact, and show that our model is perfectly adapted to inverse statics. Compared to lower-order models, the super-clothoid appears as a more natural and aesthetic primitive for bridging the gap between 2D geometric design and physics-based deformation.},

abstract = {Simulating human hair is recognized as one of the most difficult tasks in computer animation. In this paper, we show that the Kirchhoff equations for dynamic, inextensible elastic rods can be used for accurately predicting hair motion. These equations fully account for the nonlinear behavior of hair strands with respect to bending and twisting. We introduce a novel deformable model for solving them: each strand is represented by a Super-Helix, i.e., a piecewise helical rod which is animated using the principles of Lagrangian mechanics. This results in a realistic and stable simulation, allowing large time steps. Our second contribution is an in-depth validation of the Super-Helix model, carried out through a series of experiments based on the comparison of real and simulated hair motions. We show that our model efficiently handles a wide range of hair types with a high level of realism.},

abstract = {Thin elastic filaments in real world such as vine tendrils, hair ringlets or curled ribbons often depict a very smooth, curved shape that low-order rod models — e.g., segment-based rods — fail to reproduce accurately and compactly. In this paper, we push for- ward the investigation of high-order models for thin, inextensible elastic rods by building the dynamics of a G2-continuous piecewise 3D clothoid: a smooth space curve with piecewise affine curvature. With the aim of precisely integrating the rod kinematic problem, for which no closed-form solution exists, we introduce a dedicated integration scheme based on power series expansions. It turns out that our algorithm reaches machine precision orders of magnitude faster compared to classical numerical integrators. This property, nicely preserved under simple algebraic and differential operations, allows us to compute all spatial terms of the rod kinematics and dynamics in both an efficient and accurate way. Combined with a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme, our method leads to the effi- cient and robust simulation of arbitrary curly filaments that exhibit rich, visually pleasing configurations and motion. Our approach was successfully applied to generate various scenarios such as the unwinding of a curled ribbon as well as the aesthetic animation of spiral-like hair or the fascinating growth of twining plants.

abstract = {We present algorithms for simulating and visualizing the insertion and steering of needles through deformable tissues for surgical training and planning. Needle insertion is an essential component of many clinical procedures such as biopsies, injections, neurosurgery, and brachytherapy cancer treatment. The success of these procedures depends on accurate guidance of the needle tip to a clinical target while avoiding vital tissues. Needle insertion deforms body tissues, making accurate placement difficult. Our interactive needle insertion simulator models the coupling between a steerable needle and deformable tissue. We introduce (1) a novel algorithm for local remeshing that quickly enforces the conformity of a tetrahedral mesh to a curvilinear needle path, enabling accurate computation of contact forces, (2) an efficient method for coupling a 3D finite element simulation with a 1D inextensible rod with stick-slip friction, and (3) optimizations that reduce the computation time for physically based simulations. We can realistically and interactively simulate needle insertion into a prostate mesh of 13,375 tetrahedra and 2,763 vertices at a 25 Hz frame rate on an 8-core 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon PC. The simulation models prostate brachytherapy with needles of varying stiffness, steering needles around obstacles, and supports motion planning for robotic needle insertion. We evaluate the accuracy of the simulation by comparing against real-world experiments in which flexible, steerable needles were inserted into gel tissue phantoms.},

@article{Derouet-Jourdan2013,
abstract = {In the latest years, considerable progress has been achieved for ac- curately acquiring the geometry of human hair, thus largely improv- ing the realism of virtual characters. In parallel, rich physics-based simulators have been successfully designed to capture the intricate dynamics of hair due to contact and friction. However, at the mo- ment there exists no consistent pipeline for converting a given hair geometry into a realistic physics-based hair model. Current ap- proaches simply initialize the hair simulator with the input geom- etry in the absence of external forces. This results in an undesired sagging effect when the dynamic simulation is started, which basi- cally ruins all the efforts put into the accurate design and/or capture of the input hairstyle. In this paper we propose the first method which consistently and robustly accounts for surrounding forces — gravity and frictional contacts, including hair self-contacts — when converting a geometric hairstyle into a physics-based hair model. Taking an arbitrary hair geometry as input together with a corre- sponding body mesh, we interpret the hair shape as a static equilib- rium configuration of a hair simulator, in the presence of gravity as well as hair-body and hair-hair frictional contacts. Assuming that hair parameters are homogeneous and lie in a plausible range of physical values, we show that this large underdetermined inverse problem can be formulated as a well-posed constrained optimiza- tion problem, which can be solved robustly and efficiently by lever- aging the frictional contact solver of the direct hair simulator. Our method was successfully applied to the animation of various hair geometries, ranging from synthetic hairstyles manually designed by an artist to the most recent human hair data automatically recon- structed from capture.},

Constrained optimization is approached somewhat differently from unconstrained optimization because the goal is not to find the global optima. Often, constrained optimization methods use unconstrained optimization as a sub-step. In this paper, I first set up the constrained optimization problem, introduce several optimization methods, and apply it to a toy problem. Then I introduce the real-world application of data classification, which utilizes constrained optimization. I apply the applicable methods to a 2-D classification problem before demonstrating the full capability on handwritten numeral identification using real data.},

After a brief historical note, details of the parameters that govern the design of nexorades are introduced together with details of the assembly. These parameters induce strong geometrical constrains on this kind of structures so that a form-finding step is required. It is suggested here to introduce a fictitious mechanical behaviour to solve this problem. The dynamic relaxation algorithm is used with a model that takes into account the eccentricity between the elements. Its implementation is explained and its versatility is illustrated through several examples covering various fields of applications going from form-finding problems to non-linear structural analysis of structures. In a last example the structural behaviour of nexorades is compared with more conventional triangulated structures.},

abstract = {Applications in which composite materials are used as bearing structural elements are rare and generally copy structural solutions that have been optimized for steel for years. Unfortunately these materials have very different properties, therefore specific construction methods and specific structural forms have to be invented for composite materials. Gridshell structures may be one of those. So, after a brief history of gridshells, a demonstration with the Ashby's method that glass fibre reinforced polymers are an alternative for this kind of structure is shown. An original experimental test for the identification of the parameters of the short and long time behaviours of bent pultruded tubes is then detailed. Afterwards a scale one prototype of composite gridshell is presented and loaded. Results of the experimental tests are compared to numerical results of a non-linear analysis done with the dynamic relaxation method. The authors then concluded on the feasibility of such composite gridshells and on their potential for future development. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In 1975, the gridshell of Mannheim's Bundesgartenschau revealed the extraordinary aesthetic potential of a new type of lightweight structures with very interesting mechanical properties; it however did not become widespread. This article shows how composite materials can be an original and profitable solution for such constructions. In the first section, the authors recall the principal characteristics of gridshells. They explain then why glass fibres reinforced polymers provide a very attractive solution for this kind of application. The second section is dedicated to the numerical modelling of the structure. The basic principles of the dynamic relaxation method are presented. The third section shows the results of the measures taken on the prototype built at the Navier Institute and compares them with the results of the numerical simulations. A fourth section deals with the roofing solutions of such structures, and shows scale: 1 realisation. Finally the authors conclude on the potential of such structures for larger span constructions.},

abstract = {Tensile fabric structures are used for large-scale iconic structures worldwide, yet analysis and design methodologies are not codified in most countries and there is limited design guidance available. Non-linear material behaviour, large strains and displacements and the use of membrane action to resist loads require a fundamentally different approach to structural analysis and design compared to conventional roof structures.The aim of the round robin analysis exercise presented here is to understand the current state of analysis practice for tensile fabric structures, and to assess the level of consistency and harmony in current practice. The exercise consists of four precisely defined tensile fabric structures, with participants required to carry out the form finding and load analysis of each structure and report key values of stress, deflection and reactions.The results show very high levels of variability in terms of stresses, displacements, reactions and material design strengths, and highlight the need for future work to harmonise analysis methods and provide validation and benchmarking for membrane analysis software. Greater consistency is required to give confidence in the analysis and design process, to enable third party checking to be carried out in a meaningful and efficient manner, to provide a harmonious approach for Eurocode development, and to enable the full potential of tensile structures to be realised. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The paper contributes a general dynamical formulation and numerical solution procedure for studying nonlinear and three-dimensional dynamics of Kirchhoff rods. Target applications include the dynamic formation of DNA loops and supercoils as well as loops (hockles) in marine cables. The formulation accommodates non-homogeneous and non-isotropic inextensible rods both with and without coupling of tension and torsion. The utility of this formulation is illustrated by studying the dynamics and quasi-static response of a clamped-clamped rod subject to compression and/or twist. For slow loading rates, the computed quasi-static responses converge to published equilibrium solutions for a benchmark problem. As loading rates increase, new behaviors are observed including hysteresis in the neighborhood of equilibrium bifurcations. The addition of chirality in the form of tension-torsion coupling has a pronounced influence on the computed looped geometries. This finding has implications for DNA loops formed by DNA-protein binding as well as loop formation in helically wound wire and synthetic cables. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Computer simulations play an ever growing role for the development of automotive products. Assembly simulation, as well as many other processes, are used systematically even before the first physical prototype of a vehicle is built in order to check whether particular components can be assembled easily or whether another part is in the way. Usually, this kind of simulation is limited to rigid bodies. However, a vehicle contains a multitude of flexi- ble parts of various types: cables, hoses, carpets, seat surfaces, insulations, weatherstrips... Since most of the problems using these simulations concern one-dimensional components and since an intuitive tool for cable routing is still needed, we have chosen to concentrate on this category, which includes cables, hoses and wiring harnesses. In this thesis, we present a system for simulating one dimensional flexible parts such as cables or hoses. The modeling of bending and torsion follows the Cosserat model. For this purpose we use a generalized spring-mass system and describe its configuration by a carefully chosen set of coordinates. Grav- ity and contact forces as well as the forces responsible for length conservation are expressed in Cartesian coordinates. But bending and torsion effects can be dealt with more effectively by using quaternions to represent the orienta- tion of the segments joining two neighboring mass points. This augmented system allows an easy formulation of all interactions with the best appropri- ate coordinate type and yields a strongly banded Hessian matrix. An energy minimizing process accounts for a solution exempt from the oscillations that are typical of spring-mass systems. The use of integral forces, similar to an integral controller, allows to enforce exactly the constraints. The whole sys- tem is numerically stable and can be solved at interactive frame rates. It is integrated in the DaimlerChrysler in-house Virtual Reality Software veo for use in applications such as cable routing and assembly simulation and has been well received by users.},

abstract = {gridshell is a structure that gains its strength and stiffness through its double curvature configuration. Its advantages are a minimum use of materials, structural efficiency and the creation of a large volume, as well as the potential for quick and cost-effective construction. However, few gridshells have been built due to a lack of knowledge and data. The process of creating the Downland Gridshell, as a specialist museum workshop completed in the spring of 2002, is a case study of successful collaboration and innovation in architecture, engineering and construction led by a multidisciplinary team of practitioners. This gridshell structure was composed of a double layer of mats comprising four layers of thin timber laths. These were harnessed together as a flat mat and then formed into a three-dimensional structure by a carefully orchestrated lowering of each supporting scaffolding prop, thereby harnessing gravity to pull the mat into shape. Many innovations are described in detail: team working, risk sharing, multidisciplinary design, structural modelling, the creation of new structural components, cladding, and construction processes including the sequence and techniques of gridshell forming. Advances made in this project have added to the knowledge of gridshell behaviour, construction and cost, thereby making the design and construction of future timber gridshells a more viable option.},

abstract = {The light and freeform tension structures are interesting from a structural as well as architectural point of view. With the possibility to span long distances using minimum material they can also be a sustainable option. The simplicity in the shape of fabric structures is not, however, reflected in the design process which is made complex by the flexibility of the material. Applied loads have a big impact on the final shape of the structure and the unique shapes of tensioned cable net and membrane structures cannot be described by simple mathematical methods. The shape has to be found through a form-finding process either with physical or computer models, a process that is made more complex by the need to include geometrically non-linear behavior and the anisotropic material properties of the fabric. In this master thesis one approach for formfinding and analyzing tension membrane structures is described. Focus has been on the conceptual stage. For this the computer software SMART Form has been further developed, enabling the possibility to do real-time formfinding and analysis of fabric structures. The software is based on a method where the orthotropic membrane is modeled with a triangular mesh, where the mass is lumped on the nodes. As a computational tool dynamic relaxation is used to find the static equilibrium configuration for the structure. The advantage with this is that there is no need for formulation and manipulation of matrices common in the finite element method. The results generated by the software is verified by comparing them with hand- calculations as well as with results from analyses done in another software, Tensyl. Results from parametric studies are shown, and finally the tool is used for conceptual designs for a stadium fa{\c{c}}ade. Based on these simple test cases the software seems to be working fine.

abstract = {A theory of discrete Cosserat rods is formulated in the language of discrete Lagrangian mechanics. By exploiting Kirchhoff's kinetic analogy, the potential energy density of a rod is a function on the tangent bundle of the configuration manifold and thus formally corresponds to the Lagrangian function of a dynamical system. The equilibrium equations are derived from a variational principle using a formulation that involves null-space matrices. In this formulation, no Lagrange multipliers are necessary to enforce orthonormality of the directors. Noether's theorem relates first integrals of the equilibrium equations to Lie group actions on the configuration bundle, so-called symmetries. The symmetries relevant for rod mechanics are frame-indifference, isotropy, and uniformity. We show that a completely analogous and self-contained theory of discrete rods can be formulated in which the arc-length is a discrete variable ab initio. In this formulation, the potential energy density is defined directly on pairs of points along the arc-length of the rod, in analogy to Veselov's discrete reformulation of Lagrangian mechanics. A discrete version of Noether's theorem then identifies exact first integrals of the discrete equilibrium equations. These exact conservation properties confer the discrete solutions accuracy and robustness, as demonstrated by selected examples of application.},

abstract = {Yarn-based cloth simulation can improve visual quality but at high computational costs due to the reliance on numerous persistent yarn-yarn contacts to generate material behavior. Finding so many contacts in densely interlinked geometry is a pathological case for traditional collision detection, and the sheer number of contact interactions makes contact processing the simulation bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a method for approximating penalty-based contact forces in yarn-yarn collisions by computing the exact contact response at one time step, then using a rotated linear force model to approximate forces in nearby deformed configurations. Because contacts internal to the cloth exhibit good temporal coherence, sufficient accuracy can be obtained with infrequent updates to the approximation, which are done adaptively in space and time. Furthermore, by tracking contact models we reduce the time to detect new contacts. The end result is a 7- to 9-fold speedup in contact processing and a 4- to 5-fold overall speedup, enabling simulation of character-scale garments.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical and numerical framework to compute bifurcations of equilibria and stability of slender elastic rods. The 3D kinematics of the rod is treated in a geo- metrically exact way by parameterizing the position of the centerline and making use of quaternions to represent the orientation of the material frame. The equilibrium equations and the stability of their solutions are derived from the mechanical energy which takes into account the contributions due to internal moments (bending and twist), external forces and torques. Our use of quaternions allows for the equilibrium equations to be written in a quadratic form and solved efficiently with an asymptotic numerical continuation method. This finite element perturbation method gives interactive access to semi-analytical equilibrium branches, in contrast with the individual solution points obtained from classical minimization or predictor–corrector techniques. By way of example, we apply our numerics to address the specific problem of a naturally curved and heavy rod under extreme twisting and perform a detailed comparison against our own precision model experiments of this system. Excellent quantitative agreement is found between experiments and simulations for the underlying 3D buckling instabilities and the characterization of the resulting complex configurations. We believe that our framework is a powerful alternative to other methods for the computation of nonlinear equilibrium 3D shapes of rods in practical scenarios. {\&}},

abstract = {Dynamic relaxation (DR) has been widely used as a powerful method for structural analysis and form-finding. Compared with the direct stiffness method, one advantage of DR is that there is no need to compose a global stiffness matrix; for DR, every node of the structure can be seen as a single particle constrained by forces generated by the interactive mechanism of the structural members. The equations of motion for particles are much easier to consider than the direct stiffness approach, especially when structures undergo large displacements and rotations. However, most applications of DR are restricted in the field of cable, membrane, hanging chain structures. The common feature behind these structures is that only three degree of freedom (3- DOF) nodes are used. And for 3-DOF nodes, no bending moment but translational forces can be applied. In this paper, we propose the rotation formulations for DR. The description of motion of one particle is then separated into two parts, the translational and the rotational. Therefore, additional rotation degree of freedom is introduced into the computation system and we can use DR to simulate structure systems composed of 6-DOF nodes. We further show how we apply the 6-DOF DR, with the beam mechanism, to the simulation of framed structures. Validity is examined through examples of structures which undergo large displacements},

abstract = {A basic technique for designing curved shapes in the plane is interpolating splines. The designer inputs a sequence of control points, and the computer fits a smooth curve that goes through these points. The literature of interpolating splines is rich, much of it based on the mathematical idealization of a thin elastic strip constrained to pass through the points. Until now there is little consensus on which, if any, of these splines is ideal. This thesis explores the properties of an ideal interpolating spline. The most important property is fairness, a property often in tension with locality, meaning that perturbations to the input points do not affect sections of the curve at a distance. The idealized elastic strip has two serious problems. A sequence of co-circular input points results in a curve deviating from a circular arc. For some other inputs, no solution (with finite extent) exists at all.},

@phdthesis{Olsson2012,
abstract = {In the pursuit of performance-based architecture there is an increased demand for integration between engineers and architects, between analysis and design. The key to make wise choices early in a design process, has previously been based on experience from prior work and experiments with physical models. With modern computational power those choices can be supplemented with real-time feedback from analysis tools. But few programs are designed for the type of light weight, real-time analysis that can be useful in the exploration of an architectural concept. This has been the target for a research and development team, SMART Solutions, at Buro Happold. SMART Form is a tool for performance-based architecture as a plug-in for the 3D modeling software Rhinoceros. It combines analysis and rationalization of complex geometries with form finding and sculpting of structures, driven by a dynamic relaxation solver. The plugin transforms the 3D modeling software to a virtual physical environment, influenced by various forces and a gravitational field. It enables sketching and sculpting of efficient compression (shells and gridshells) and tension structures (cable nets and membranes). The purpose for the thesis has been to advance SMART Form by implementing beam elements and explore how bending action can be used in the form finding process, allowing for a compromise between initial geometry and fully form found geometry. Automatic sizing of the beam elements is also implemented as a method to evaluate form. The thesis leads to an investigation of how to conduct conceptual structural design, and how this process can potentially be approached differently with the means of real-time feedback from analysis, form finding and sizing. In order to allow for real-time analysis an iterative technique called dynamic relaxation is used as the computational solver. As a result of the exploration of form finding with bending action a method called Limit control form finding was developed. This method enables form optimization of the most critical parts of a structure by specifying a limit for the bending capability of the elements. It was found to work in a good way for 2D structures but sometimes resulting in a less appealing, wrinkled looking grids for 3D structures. Dynamic relaxation is found to be a suitable method for real time analysis, although with some important issues regarding speed. The number of iterations needed to reach convergence is concluded to depend on the relation between local and global stiffness for each node in the structure. Hence the method works efficiently for some types of structural configuration (for example gridshells with a locally weak direction), while a conventional matrix solver would perhaps be more suitable for other cases (for example space truss structures). The implemented functionality, such as form finding using cables, limit control and automatic sizing is demonstrated with a couple of test cases. One of which is the Exeter gridshell roof where engineers at Buro Happold have been involved from the concept design to the realized structure. The real design process for the project is shown and new approach based on real time feedback is demonstrated. With the new functionality implemented during the thesis, SMART Form has become a much more sophisticated tool, and a great improvement for the design process of the Exeter roof could be made. Due to the possibilities of a quick and efficient collaborative design process, that comes with the new tool, it seems to offer great potential in bridging between engineers and architects in structural concept design.

abstract = {This paper describes a new digital computer method of computation of the stresses and displacements in a thick-walled pressure vessel, using a damped wave equation modification of the elastostatic continuum equations, which are formulated as finite difference equivalents using centred differences both in time and space with the damping arranged to be approximately dead-beat. The method is developed from a similar method used for the solution of the tidal flow equations in one- and two-dimensions (Appendix A), and for illustration, two simple calculations are given in detail for one-dimensional elastic and thermoelastic problems in a bar. The technique is developed for axially symmetric pressure vessels using cylindrical polar coordinates and a discussion is given of the boundary conditions, the damping factor and the stability criterion to be used, and the number of iterations required in the calculations. A typical instance is given of calculations for an actual pressure vessel. The possibility of estimating stress or temperature dependent creep in the frame of the dynamic relaxation method is discussed. Finally, the application of the method to other forms of partial differential equation is suggested (Appendix B).},

We systematically study variants of the First Fit Decreasing (FFD) algorithm that have been proposed for this problem. Inspired by bad instances for FFD-type algorithms, we propose new geometric heuristics that run nearly as fast as FFD for reasonable values of {\$}n{\$} and {\$}d{\$}. We report on empirical evaluations of the FFD-based, as well as the new heuristics on large families of distributions. We identify which FFD variants work best in most cases and show that our new heuristics usually outperform FFD-based heuristics and can sometimes reduce the number of bins used by up to ten percent. Further, in all cases where we were able to compute the optimal solution we found our new heuristics within few percent of optimal. We conclude that these new heuristics are an excellent alternative to FFD-based heuristics and are prime candidates to be used in practice.},

abstract = {Elastic rods are thin flexible objects typically undergoing large non-linear deformations that cannot be modeled with linear methods. They are used in a number of research fields, e.g., to represent hair or ropes in animations, or catheters or needles in medical simulations. In this paper, we propose a deformation model for inextensible elastic rods. The method of Lagrange multipliers is employed to enforce the inextensibility of the rod, and to couple the material frames with the centerline. The resulting system is banded, allowing for an efficient linear time solution. We also propose a manifold projection method to incorporate the non-penetration constraints resulting from contact handling into our constrained Lagrangian mechanics (CLM) problem.We further augment the contact model by treating torsional friction. This allows to reproduce friction effects such as dynamic rolling and twisting of rods. Various examples underline the benefits and applicability of our model.

abstract = {Simulating one-dimensional elastic objects such as threads, ropes or hair strands is a difficult problem, especially if material torsion is considered. In this paper, we present CORDE(french ’rope’), a novel deformation model for the dynamic interactive simulation of elastic rods with torsion. We derive continuous energies for a dynamically deforming rod based on the Cosserat theory of elastic rods. We then discretize the rod and compute energies per element by employing finite element methods. Thus, the global dynamic behavior is independent of the discretization. The dynamic evolution of the rod is obtained by numerical integration of the resulting Lagrange equations of motion. We further show how this system of equations can be decoupled and efficiently solved. Since the centerline of the rod is explicitly represented, the deformation model allows for accurate contact and self-contact handling. Thus, we can reproduce many important looping phenomena. Further, a broad variety of different materials can be simulated at interactive rates. Experiments underline the physical plausibility of our deformation model.},

We further propose a dynamic model that allows for the efficient simulation of elastic rods. We then focus on the simulation of the Cosserat nets by extending the elastic rod deformation model to branched and looped topologies. To round out the discussion, we evaluate our deformation model.

abstract = {Due to its minimal twist, the rotation minimizing frame (RMF) is widely used in computer graphics, including sweep or blending surface modeling, motion design and control in computer animation and robotics, streamline visualization, and tool path planning in CAD/CAM.We present a novel simple and efficient method for accurate and stable computation of RMF of a curve in 3D. This method, called the double reflection method, uses two reflections to compute each frame from its preceding one to yield a sequence of frames to approximate an exactRMF. The double reflection method has the fourth order global approximation error, thus it is much more accurate than the two currently prevailing methods with the second order approximation error—the projection method by Klok and the rotation method by Bloomenthal, while all these methods have nearly the same per-frame computational cost. Furthermore, the double reflection method is much simpler and faster than using the standard fourth order Runge-Kutta method to integrate the defining ODE of the RMF, though they have the same accuracy. We also investigate further properties and extensions of the double reflection method, and discuss the variational principles in design moving frames with boundary conditions, based on RMF.},

abstract = {This article presents an example nonlinear static problem. Th e problem is solved by both an explicit and implicit analysis. In both cases an incremental load control scheme is used. The example as presented is certainly contrived. To a beginne r some aspects of this exercise may seem strange. However, the example problem is constructed to illustrate a variety of concepts that arise in a typical nonlinear finite element anal ysis. It is helpful to think of this exercise as providing some introductory tools that are use ful to know for future problems.},

@article{Zupan2009,
abstract = {This paper presents the equations for the implementation of rotational quaternions in the geometrically exact three-dimensional beam theory. A new finite-element formulation is proposed in which the rota- tional quaternions are used for parametrization of rotations along the length of the beam. The formula- tion also satisfies the consistency condition that the equilibrium and the constitutive internal force and moment vectors are equal in its weak form. A strict use of the quaternion algebra in the derivation of gov- erning equations and for the numerical solution is presented. Several numerical examples demonstrate the validity, performance and accuracy of the proposed approach.},
