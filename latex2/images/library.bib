abstract = {This paper considers a class of tensegrity structures with continuous tubular compression booms forming curved splines, which may be deployed from straight by prestressing a cable bracing system. A free-form arch structure for the support of prestressed membranes is reviewed and the concepts are extended to a two-way spanning system for double layer grid shell structures. A numerical analysis based on the Dynamic Relaxation (DR) method is developed which caters specifically for the form-finding and load analysis of this type of structure; a particular feature of the analysis is that bending components are treated in a finite difference form with three degrees of freedom per node rather than six. This simplifies the treatment of sliding collar nodes which may be used along the continuous compression booms of deployable systems.},

abstract = {Barre, poutre, verge, arc, tige, filament, fil, corde, etc. Que de mots pour définir le même type d'objets élastique : un corps allongé dont les dimensions transverses sont petites par rapport à sa dimension longitudinale. La structure, dite élancée, est dans ce cas vue comme un objet élas- tique à une dimension et les équations de l'élasticité 3D sont remplacées par des équations plus simples : les équations d'équilibre sont, par exemple, des équations différentielles ordinaires. Les différentes appellations utilisées permettent en fait de caractériser le comportement élastique de l'objet : une barre reste rigide en flexion mais pourra s'étirer (ou se contracter) si soumise à un ef- fort axial, une poutre fléchit sous l'effet d'un effort de flexion, un arc est une poutre dont la forme naturelle est courbe, une tige fléchit et se tord dans les trois dimensions d'espace, un filament est une tige microscopique soumise aux fluctuations thermiques. Les termes fil et corde sont ré- servés à des corps élastiques parfaitement flexibles qui s'étirent si soumis à une force de tension. Les objets étudiés dans ce mémoire sont soit des poutres, soit des tiges, en grandes rotations. C'est le terme 'tige' qui apparaît quasi exclusivement dans le texte. L'histoire de l'étude scientifique des déformations des tiges élastiques remonte au moins à Galilée [Galilee 38].

abstract = {This paper describes a new digital computer method of computation of the stresses and displacements in a thick-walled pressure vessel, using a damped wave equation modification of the elastostatic continuum equations, which are formulated as finite difference equivalents using centred differences both in time and space with the damping arranged to be approximately dead-beat. The method is developed from a similar method used for the solution of the tidal flow equations in one- and two-dimensions (Appendix A), and for illustration, two simple calculations are given in detail for one-dimensional elastic and thermoelastic problems in a bar. The technique is developed for axially symmetric pressure vessels using cylindrical polar coordinates and a discussion is given of the boundary conditions, the damping factor and the stability criterion to be used, and the number of iterations required in the calculations. A typical instance is given of calculations for an actual pressure vessel. The possibility of estimating stress or temperature dependent creep in the frame of the dynamic relaxation method is discussed. Finally, the application of the method to other forms of partial differential equation is suggested (Appendix B).},

abstract = {Simulating human hair is recognized as one of the most difficult tasks in computer animation. In this paper, we show that the Kirchhoff equations for dynamic, inextensible elastic rods can be used for accurately predicting hair motion. These equations fully account for the nonlinear behavior of hair strands with respect to bending and twisting. We introduce a novel deformable model for solving them: each strand is represented by a Super-Helix, i.e., a piecewise helical rod which is animated using the principles of Lagrangian mechanics. This results in a realistic and stable simulation, allowing large time steps. Our second contribution is an in-depth validation of the Super-Helix model, carried out through a series of experiments based on the comparison of real and simulated hair motions. We show that our model efficiently handles a wide range of hair types with a high level of realism.},

abstract = {Active bending structures need materials with specific mechanical properties such as large admissible strain and sufficiently high stiffness to prevent buckling. This paper proposes to investigate the materials that could be used following Ashby's selection method. Then it focuses on the most affordable materials which are glass fibre reinforced polymers (GFRP) and natural fibre reinforced polymers (NFRP). As the initial selection is based on short term characteristics, the long term behaviour of fibre reinforced polymers is then addressed based on recent durability studies which are needed to ensure the performance, reliability and safety of a structure. It is shown that, depending on the loading type (tension, bending, torsion, alone or in combination...) and on the nature of the components (fibres, matrix and interfaces), the material undergoes several phenomena reducing its mechanical performances and potentially leading to its failure. Finally, this knowledge of the materials, which allows for a better understanding of the specific relation between the material and the active bending structures, is used to give a framework for stress limitations and recommendations for further optimisation of reliable structures.},

After a brief historical note, details of the parameters that govern the design of nexorades are introduced together with details of the assembly. These parameters induce strong geometrical constrains on this kind of structures so that a form-finding step is required. It is suggested here to introduce a fictitious mechanical behaviour to solve this problem. The dynamic relaxation algorithm is used with a model that takes into account the eccentricity between the elements. Its implementation is explained and its versatility is illustrated through several examples covering various fields of applications going from form-finding problems to non-linear structural analysis of structures. In a last example the structural behaviour of nexorades is compared with more conventional triangulated structures.},

abstract = {Form-finding for membrane tension structures is a delicate operation which must ensure both the absence of compressive areas and interactive control of the forms generated. Until now, methods have generally been based on large displacements and strain analysis that provide non-linear formulations; resolution and computation are, therefore, too complex and cumbersome. This paper describes a new method of form-finding which reflects a wish to provide architects with a simple, effective and reliable investigation suited to their needs. The surface stress density method uses surface triangular elements with an isotropic stress tensor and leads to an iterative procedure which converges on configurations that satisfy the laws of static equilibrium. Mathematical considerations ensure the convergence conditions. This method enables the designer to generate a broad range of structures (pneumatic membranes or cable-reinforced membranes), while conserving control of shape and internal stress distribution. Moreover, the formulation draws a parallel with the force density method and a combined approach may be specified, particularly for the monitoring of reinforcing cable.},

abstract = {The paper contributes a general dynamical formulation and numerical solution procedure for studying nonlinear and three-dimensional dynamics of Kirchhoff rods. Target applications include the dynamic formation of DNA loops and supercoils as well as loops (hockles) in marine cables. The formulation accommodates non-homogeneous and non-isotropic inextensible rods both with and without coupling of tension and torsion. The utility of this formulation is illustrated by studying the dynamics and quasi-static response of a clamped-clamped rod subject to compression and/or twist. For slow loading rates, the computed quasi-static responses converge to published equilibrium solutions for a benchmark problem. As loading rates increase, new behaviors are observed including hysteresis in the neighborhood of equilibrium bifurcations. The addition of chirality in the form of tension-torsion coupling has a pronounced influence on the computed looped geometries. This finding has implications for DNA loops formed by DNA-protein binding as well as loop formation in helically wound wire and synthetic cables. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Due to its minimal twist, the rotation minimizing frame (RMF) is widely used in computer graphics, including sweep or blending surface modeling, motion design and control in computer animation and robotics, streamline visualization, and tool path planning in CAD/CAM.We present a novel simple and efficient method for accurate and stable computation of RMF of a curve in 3D. This method, called the double reflection method, uses two reflections to compute each frame from its preceding one to yield a sequence of frames to approximate an exactRMF. The double reflection method has the fourth order global approximation error, thus it is much more accurate than the two currently prevailing methods with the second order approximation error—the projection method by Klok and the rotation method by Bloomenthal, while all these methods have nearly the same per-frame computational cost. Furthermore, the double reflection method is much simpler and faster than using the standard fourth order Runge-Kutta method to integrate the defining ODE of the RMF, though they have the same accuracy. We also investigate further properties and extensions of the double reflection method, and discuss the variational principles in design moving frames with boundary conditions, based on RMF.},

abstract = {Timber gridshell structures, such as the Multihalle for the federal garden festival in Mannheim or the Downland Museum, have been the result of a creative–generative process that indissolubly ‘welded' the structural contribution to that of form exploration. The challenging design and construction issues have been typically addressed and resolved in several inventive ways. However, still now, form-finding and erection of timber gridshells present many difficulties. In this regard, this paper aims to provide a series of novel steps to address some of the main design and construction issues that are associated with ‘actively-bent' timber gridshell structures. First, the main characteristics of the construction process of timber gridshells are described and the basic theoretical concepts for its numerical simulation, through Dynamic Relaxation method, are introduced. Second, a practical method for sizing the laths' cross-section is presented. Third, a new erection technique for timber gridshells is proposed and applied to the construction of a full scale (prototype) structure, the Toledo gridshell 2.0. Fourth, a new bracing system for the same structure, which was built at the Faculty of Architecture, University of Naples Federico II in June–July 2014, is explained and discussed. The paper also highlights the need for further application to validate the techniques explained here, with particular attention being paid for the construction of large scale free-form structures.},

Our approach differs from existing simulation techniques in the graphics and mechanics lit- erature both in the kinematic description—we represent the mate- rial frame by its angular deviation from the natural Bishop frame— as well as in the dynamical treatment—we treat the centerline as dynamic and the material frame as quasistatic. Additionally, we describe a manifold projection method for coupling rods to rigid- bodies and simultaneously enforcing rod inextensibility. The use of quasistatics and constraints provides an efficient treatment for stiff twisting and stretching modes; at the same time, we retain the dy- namic bending of the centerline and accurately reproduce the cou- pling between bending and twisting modes. We validate the discrete rod model via quantitative buckling, stability, and coupled-mode experiments, and via qualitative knot-tying comparisons.},

These methods are accurate, but do not directly fit into the more efficient position-based dynamics framework, since the definition of material frames are not entirely based on positions. We introduce ghost points, which are additional points defined on edges, to naturally endow continuous material frames on discretized rods. We achieve robustness by a novel discretization of the Cosserat theory. The method supports coupling with a frame, a triangle, and a rigid body at the rod's end point. Our formulation is highly efficient, capable of simulating hundreds of strands in real-time. Categories},

The authors propose an analytical tool to explain these experimental aspects, based on a model of multi-layered materials involving one stress field per layer (layerwise). The static model takes cracks and delaminations into account. Criteria of crack initiations in wood thickness and along the interfaces are proposed and experimentally identified. Finally the model allows the simulation of the fracture of a concrete/reinforced wood beam in bending and/or tension. The simulations appear very close to the experimental results and highlight the potential of the concept.},

While these measures have applications in molecular biology, materials science, fluid mechanics and astrophysics, they are under-utilized because they are often considered difficult to compute. In addition, many applications involve curves with endpoints (open curves); but for these curves the definition of writhe can be ambiguous. This paper provides simple expressions for the writhe of closed curves, and provides a new definition of writhe for open curves. The open curve definition is especially appropriate when the curve is anchored at endpoints on a plane or stretches between two parallel planes. This definition can be especially useful for magnetic flux tubes in the solar atmosphere, and for isotropic rods with ends fixed to a plane.},

abstract = {THE CRAFT OF SCIENTIFIC PRESENTATIONS provides a score of examples from contemporary and historical scientific presentations to show clearly what makes an oral presentation effective. It considers presentations made to persuade an audience to adopt some course of action (such as funding a proposal) as well as presentations made to communicate information, and it considers these from four perspectives: speech, structure, visual aids, and delivery. In keeping with technological innovations, it discusses computer-based projections and slide shows as well as overhead projections. In particular, it discusses ways of organizing graphics and text in projected images and of using layout and design to present the information efficiently and effectively. Unlike other books that discuss technical presentations, this book anchors its advice in the experiences of scientists and engineers, including such successful presenters as Robert Oppenheimer, Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, and Rita Levi-Montalcini, as well as currently active laboratory directors, scientists, and engineers. In addition to examining successful presentations, Alley also discusses the errors that cause many scientific presentations to flounder, providing a list of ten critical errors to avoid. The insights and tools in this book will guide readers to deliver outstanding presentations. Praise for Michael Alley's THE CRAFT OF SCIENTIFIC PRESENTATIONS: "Alley has revamped the way our research center makes the way we design our presentation slides." DANIEL J. INMAN, DIRECTOR CENTER FOR INTELLIGENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS "This book fills a void by illustrating key issues and difficulties in oral presentations with the experiences of others."

@techreport{Menninger2013,
abstract = {In classical curve theory, the geometry of a curve in three dimensions is essentially characterized by their invariants, curvature and torsion. When they are given, the problem of finding a corresponding curve is known as 'solving natural equations'. Explicit solutions are known only for a handful of curve classes, including notably the plane curves and general helices. This paper shows constructively how to solve the natural equations explicitly for an infinite series of curve classes. For every Frenet curve, a family of successor curves can be constructed which have the tangent of the original curve as principal normal. Helices are exactly the successor curves of plane curves and applying the successor transformation to helices leads to slant helices, a class of curves that has received considerable attention in recent years as a natural extension of the concept of general helices. The present paper gives for the first time a generic characterization of the slant helix in three-dimensional Euclidian space in terms of its curvature and torsion, and derives an explicit arc-length parametrization of its tangent vector. These results expand on and put into perspective earlier work on Salkowski curves and curves of constant precession, both of which are subclasses of the slant helix. The paper also, for the benefit of novices and teachers, provides a novel and generalized presentation of the theory of Frenet curves, which is not restricted to curves with positive curvature. Bishop frames are examined along with Frenet frames and Darboux frames as a useful tool in the theory of space curves. The closed curve problem receives attention as well.},

abstract = {The light and freeform tension structures are interesting from a structural as well as architectural point of view. With the possibility to span long distances using minimum material they can also be a sustainable option. The simplicity in the shape of fabric structures is not, however, reflected in the design process which is made complex by the flexibility of the material. Applied loads have a big impact on the final shape of the structure and the unique shapes of tensioned cable net and membrane structures cannot be described by simple mathematical methods. The shape has to be found through a form-finding process either with physical or computer models, a process that is made more complex by the need to include geometrically non-linear behavior and the anisotropic material properties of the fabric. In this master thesis one approach for formfinding and analyzing tension membrane structures is described. Focus has been on the conceptual stage. For this the computer software SMART Form has been further developed, enabling the possibility to do real-time formfinding and analysis of fabric structures. The software is based on a method where the orthotropic membrane is modeled with a triangular mesh, where the mass is lumped on the nodes. As a computational tool dynamic relaxation is used to find the static equilibrium configuration for the structure. The advantage with this is that there is no need for formulation and manipulation of matrices common in the finite element method. The results generated by the software is verified by comparing them with hand- calculations as well as with results from analyses done in another software, Tensyl. Results from parametric studies are shown, and finally the tool is used for conceptual designs for a stadium fa{\c{c}}ade. Based on these simple test cases the software seems to be working fine.

@article{Treven2015,
abstract = {The problem of integrating the rotational vector from a given angular velocity vector is met in such diverse fields as the navigation, robotics, computer graphics, optical tracking and non-linear dynamics of flexible beams. For example, if the numerical formulation of non-linear dynamics of flexible beams is based on the interpolation of curvature, one needs to derive the rotation from the assumed curvature field. The relation between the angular velocity and the rotation is described by the first-order quasi-linear differential equation. If the rotation is given, the related angular velocity is obtained by the differentiation. By contrast, if the angular velocity is given, the related rotations are obtained by the integration. The exact closed-form solution for the rotation is only possible if the angular velocity is constant in time. In dynamics of non-linear flexible spatial beams, the problem of integrating rotations from a given angular velocity becomes even more complex because both the angular velocity and the curvature need simultaneously be integrated and are both functions of space and time. As the angular velocity and the curvature are assumed to be analytic functions, they must satisfy certain integrability conditions to assure the unique rotation is obtained from the two differential equations. The objective of the present paper is to derive approximate, yet closed-form solutions of the following problem: for a given curvature vector, determine both the rotation and the angular velocity. In order to avoid the singularity of kinematic relations, the quaternions are used for the parametrization of rotations, and the integrations are partly performed in the four-dimensional quaternion space. The resulting closed-form expressions for the rotational and angular velocity quaternions are ready to be used in the finite-element formulations of the dynamics of flexible spatial beams as interpolating functions. The present novel solution is assessed by comparisons of the numerical results with analytical solutions for variety of oscillating curvature functions, as well as with the solutions of the quaternion-based midpoint integrator and the Runge-Kutta-based Crouch-Grossman geometrical methods CG3 and CG4.},

The model makes use of a condensed set of coordinates, called the centerline/spin representation: the kinematic constraints linking the centerline's tangent to the orientation of the material frame is used to eliminate two out of three degrees of freedom associated with rotations. Based on a description of twist inspired from discrete differential geometry and from variational principles, we build a full-fledged discrete viscous thread model, which includes in particular a discrete representation of the internal viscous stress. Consistency of the discrete model with the classical, smooth equations for thin threads is established formally. Our numerical method is validated against reference solutions for steady coiling. The method makes it possible to simulate the unsteady behavior of thin viscous threads in a robust and efficient way, including the combined effects of inertia, stretching, bending, twisting, large rotations and surface tension.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of non-uniform torsion in thin-walled elastic beams with asymmetric cross-section, removing the basic concept of a fixed center of twist, necessary in the Vlasov's and Benscoter's theories to obtain a warping stress field equivalent to zero. In this new torsion/flexure theory, despite of the classical ones, the warping function will punctually satisfy the first indefinite equilibrium equation along the beam axis and it wont' be necessary to introduce the classical congruence condition, to take into account the effect of the beam restraints. The solution, based on the Fourier development of the displacement field, is obtained assuming that the applied external torque is constant along the beam axis and on both beam ends the unit twist angle and the warping axial displacement functions are totally restrained. Finally, in order to verify the feasibility of the proposed method and to compare it with the classical theories, two applications are carried out. The first one, relative to an open profile, is necessary to test the numerical method adopted to find the solution; the second one, instead, is relative to a simplified containership section, considered as full restrained in correspondence of two adjacent transverse bulkheads.},

This paper compares the stability of a cable-stiffened single-layer latticed shell with that of a single-layer latticed shell using a numerical analysis to investigate the stability behaviour of the new structure. In the analysis, the following influential parameters have been taken into account: (1) layouts of the cables; (2) joint types; (3) pretension in the cables; and (4) cross-sections of the cables. The results indicate that the buckling load of single-layer latticed shells is improved significantly by the introduction of the cables. For the cable-stiffened single-layer latticed shells with different layouts of cables, both the pretension in the cables and the cross-sections of the cables have a considerable effect on their stabilities. Meanwhile, the numerical analysis also indicates that although joint types have a remarkable effect on the stability of a single-layer latticed shell, the effect on the corresponding cable-stiffened single-layer latticed shell is limited. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Assembly simulation, as well as many other processes, are used systematically even before the first physical prototype of a vehicle is built in order to check whether particular components can be assembled easily or whether another part is in the way. Usually, this kind of simulation is limited to rigid bodies. However, a vehicle contains a multitude of flexi- ble parts of various types: cables, hoses, carpets, seat surfaces, insulations, weatherstrips... Since most of the problems using these simulations concern one-dimensional components and since an intuitive tool for cable routing is still needed, we have chosen to concentrate on this category, which includes cables, hoses and wiring harnesses. In this thesis, we present a system for simulating one dimensional flexible parts such as cables or hoses. The modeling of bending and torsion follows the Cosserat model. For this purpose we use a generalized spring-mass system and describe its configuration by a carefully chosen set of coordinates. Grav- ity and contact forces as well as the forces responsible for length conservation are expressed in Cartesian coordinates. But bending and torsion effects can be dealt with more effectively by using quaternions to represent the orienta- tion of the segments joining two neighboring mass points. This augmented system allows an easy formulation of all interactions with the best appropri- ate coordinate type and yields a strongly banded Hessian matrix. An energy minimizing process accounts for a solution exempt from the oscillations that are typical of spring-mass systems. The use of integral forces, similar to an integral controller, allows to enforce exactly the constraints. The whole sys- tem is numerically stable and can be solved at interactive frame rates. It is integrated in the DaimlerChrysler in-house Virtual Reality Software veo for use in applications such as cable routing and assembly simulation and has been well received by users.},

abstract = {In geometric modelling, translational and rotational sweeping are well known methods for defining the shape of 3D objects. The shape domain of sweeping can be extended by allowing objects to sweep along 3D trajectories that are represented by parametric polynomials (cubic splines, for instance), but which are otherwise arbitrary. The central problem is to define a triple of coordinates axes at each point of the trajectory in order to specify the position and orientation of the swept object along the trajectory. The resulting shape must be independent both of the parametrization and of the orientation of the trajectory in space. Two methods meeting these criteria are presented here. Geometric as well as computational properties of both methods are discussed, specifically for the case where a 2D closed curve is swept along the trajectory. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {The evolution of elastic grid shells has observed significant progress in the fields of computational form-finding, structural analysis and to some extent buildability since their inception in the 1960s. While the engineering precision of built elastic grid shells has increased on the whole (most notably Chiddingstone Orangery Savill Gardens), the size and span of modern elastic grid shells has decreased. Furthermore, building costs per square metre for such structures have also increased. Despite an increase in the frequency of elastic grid shells built in Europe over the last two decades, fuelled in part by academic curiosity, the low sample makes interpreting trends in their adoption rate difficult. Nonetheless the failure for more widespread adoption in the built environment of this low-tech, large-span building technology may be attributable to the increased serviceability demands of modernised building codes coupled with limitations or apprehension caused by health and safety legislation. While the idea has been considered before, it is argued in this paper that the use of air-inflated membrane cushions for the erection of elastic grid shells has the potential to significantly reduce the demands on structural performance of the nodes and beams when compared with the crane and cable erection method and that when compared with the scaffolding erection method, the air-inflated cushion approach can offer paralleled safety but at a fraction of the time and cost. It is believed that this technique offers a way to once again facilitate large- scale, low-cost elastic grid shell buildings in the modern built environment such as have not been since the likes of the Multihalle Mannheim.},

abstract = {Yarn-based cloth simulation can improve visual quality but at high computational costs due to the reliance on numerous persistent yarn-yarn contacts to generate material behavior. Finding so many contacts in densely interlinked geometry is a pathological case for traditional collision detection, and the sheer number of contact interactions makes contact processing the simulation bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a method for approximating penalty-based contact forces in yarn-yarn collisions by computing the exact contact response at one time step, then using a rotated linear force model to approximate forces in nearby deformed configurations. Because contacts internal to the cloth exhibit good temporal coherence, sufficient accuracy can be obtained with infrequent updates to the approximation, which are done adaptively in space and time. Furthermore, by tracking contact models we reduce the time to detect new contacts. The end result is a 7- to 9-fold speedup in contact processing and a 4- to 5-fold overall speedup, enabling simulation of character-scale garments.},

@article{DeDinechin2008,
abstract = {The floating-point implementation of a function on an interval often reduces to polynomial approximation, the polynomial being typically provided by Remez algorithm. However, the floating-point evaluation of a Remez polynomial sometimes leads to catastrophic cancellations. This happens when some of the polynomial coefficients are very small in magnitude with respects to others. In this case, it is better to force these coefficients to zero, which also reduces the operation count. This technique, classically used for odd or even functions, may be generalized to a much larger class of functions. An algorithm is presented that forces to zero the smaller coefficients of the initial polynomial thanks to a modified Remez algorithm targeting an incomplete monomial basis. One advantage of this technique is that it is purely numerical, the function being used as a numerical black box. This algorithm is implemented within a larger polynomial implementation tool that is demonstrated on a range of examples, resulting in polynomials with less coefficients than those obtained the usual way.},

@article{Derouet-Jourdan2013,
abstract = {In the latest years, considerable progress has been achieved for ac- curately acquiring the geometry of human hair, thus largely improv- ing the realism of virtual characters. In parallel, rich physics-based simulators have been successfully designed to capture the intricate dynamics of hair due to contact and friction. However, at the mo- ment there exists no consistent pipeline for converting a given hair geometry into a realistic physics-based hair model. Current ap- proaches simply initialize the hair simulator with the input geom- etry in the absence of external forces. This results in an undesired sagging effect when the dynamic simulation is started, which basi- cally ruins all the efforts put into the accurate design and/or capture of the input hairstyle. In this paper we propose the first method which consistently and robustly accounts for surrounding forces — gravity and frictional contacts, including hair self-contacts — when converting a geometric hairstyle into a physics-based hair model. Taking an arbitrary hair geometry as input together with a corre- sponding body mesh, we interpret the hair shape as a static equilib- rium configuration of a hair simulator, in the presence of gravity as well as hair-body and hair-hair frictional contacts. Assuming that hair parameters are homogeneous and lie in a plausible range of physical values, we show that this large underdetermined inverse problem can be formulated as a well-posed constrained optimiza- tion problem, which can be solved robustly and efficiently by lever- aging the frictional contact solver of the direct hair simulator. Our method was successfully applied to the animation of various hair geometries, ranging from synthetic hairstyles manually designed by an artist to the most recent human hair data automatically recon- structed from capture.},

abstract = {The last decades have seen the emergence of non-standard architectural shapes. Designers find often themselves helpless with the geometrical complexity of these objects. Furthermore, the available tools dissociate shape and structural behaviour, which adds another complication. This dissertation takes the point of view based on invariance under geometrical transformations, and studies several strategies for fabrication-aware shape modelling. Three technological constraints have been identified and correspond to three independent contributions of this thesis. The repetition of nodes is studied via transformations by parallelism. They are used to generalise surfaces of revolution. A special parametrisation of moulding surfaces is found with this method. The resulting structure has a high node congruence. Cyclidic nets are then used to model shapes parametrised by their lines of curvature. This guarantees meshing by planar panels and torsion-free beam layout. The contribution of this dissertation is the implementation of several improvements, like doubly-curved creases, a hole-filling strategy that allows the extension of cyclidic nets to complex topologies, and the generation of a generalisation of canal surfaces from two rail curves and one profile curves. Finally, an innovative method inspired by descriptive geometry is proposed to generate doubly-curved shapes covered with planar facets. The method, called marionette technique, reduces the problem to a linear problem, which can be solved in real-time. A comparative study shows that this technique can be used to parametrise shape optimisation of shell structures without loss of performance compared to usual modelling technique. The handling of fabrication constraints in shape optimisation opens new possibilities for its practical application, like gridshells or plated shell structures. The relevance of those solutions is demonstrated through multiple case-studies. Keywords},

@article{Jung2010,
abstract = {A theory of discrete Cosserat rods is formulated in the language of discrete Lagrangian mechanics. By exploiting Kirchhoff's kinetic analogy, the potential energy density of a rod is a function on the tangent bundle of the configuration manifold and thus formally corresponds to the Lagrangian function of a dynamical system. The equilibrium equations are derived from a variational principle using a formulation that involves null-space matrices. In this formulation, no Lagrange multipliers are necessary to enforce orthonormality of the directors. Noether's theorem relates first integrals of the equilibrium equations to Lie group actions on the configuration bundle, so-called symmetries. The symmetries relevant for rod mechanics are frame-indifference, isotropy, and uniformity. We show that a completely analogous and self-contained theory of discrete rods can be formulated in which the arc-length is a discrete variable ab initio. In this formulation, the potential energy density is defined directly on pairs of points along the arc-length of the rod, in analogy to Veselov's discrete reformulation of Lagrangian mechanics. A discrete version of Noether's theorem then identifies exact first integrals of the discrete equilibrium equations. These exact conservation properties confer the discrete solutions accuracy and robustness, as demonstrated by selected examples of application.},

abstract = {Elastic rods are thin flexible objects typically undergoing large non-linear deformations that cannot be modeled with linear methods. They are used in a number of research fields, e.g., to represent hair or ropes in animations, or catheters or needles in medical simulations. In this paper, we propose a deformation model for inextensible elastic rods. The method of Lagrange multipliers is employed to enforce the inextensibility of the rod, and to couple the material frames with the centerline. The resulting system is banded, allowing for an efficient linear time solution. We also propose a manifold projection method to incorporate the non-penetration constraints resulting from contact handling into our constrained Lagrangian mechanics (CLM) problem.We further augment the contact model by treating torsional friction. This allows to reproduce friction effects such as dynamic rolling and twisting of rods. Various examples underline the benefits and applicability of our model.

The principle of interconnection is illustrated with various structures which are generated using numerical toolbox developed by the laboratory for the automatic meshing of free-forms structures on Rhino. Then the effect of the interconnection on the structural behaviour is briefly discussed based on elementary loading cases. Finally, the feasibility of the concept as well as its architectural and morphological potential is show by the construction of a double gridshell prototype. The authors conclude on the possible future developments of such morphologies which could give interesting and unexpected architectures.},

Different methods of modeling torsional deformation result in different beam theories with different mathematical characteristics. Each of these three geometrically exact beam theories fully accounts for geometric nonlinearities and initial curvatures by using Jaumann strains, exact coordinate transformations, and orthogonal virtual rotations. The derivations are presented in detail, a finite element formulation is included, fully nonlinear governing equations and boundary conditions are presented, and the corresponding form for numerically exact analysis using multiple shooting methods is also derived. These theories are compared in terms of their appropriate application areas, possible singular problems, and easiness for use in modeling and analysis of multibody systems. Nonlinear finite element analysis of a rotating beam and nonlinear multiple shooting analysis of a torsional bar are performed to demonstrate the capability and accuracy of these beam theories. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Current interest in this field derives not only from its importance in pure mathematics but also from its relevance for other fields like computer graphics. Recent progress in discrete differential geometry has lead, somewhat unexpectedly, to a better understanding of some fundamental structures lying in the basis of the classical differential geometry and of the theory of integrable systems.

This volume deals with the numerical simulation of the behavior of continuous media by augmented Lagrangian and operator-splitting methods (coupled to finite-element approximations). It begins with a description of the mechanical and mathematical frameworks of the considered applications as well as a general analysis of the basic numerical methods additionally used to study them. These ideas are then applied to specific classes of mechanical problems.},

In contrast with some earlier works on the subject, discussed here are the beam elements whose reference axes are arbitrary space-curved lines. We have shown that an improved representation of curved reference geometry significantly increases the accuracy of the results. However, it also makes the choice of non-locking finite element interpolations somewhat more delicate. A hierarchical displacement interpolation proposed here is proved to be capable of eliminating both shear and membrane locking phenomena. A very satisfying non-locking performance is demonstrated for a set of problems in nonlinear elasto-statics. ?? 1995.},

We systematically study variants of the First Fit Decreasing (FFD) algorithm that have been proposed for this problem. Inspired by bad instances for FFD-type algorithms, we propose new geometric heuristics that run nearly as fast as FFD for reasonable values of {\$}n{\$} and {\$}d{\$}. We report on empirical evaluations of the FFD-based, as well as the new heuristics on large families of distributions. We identify which FFD variants work best in most cases and show that our new heuristics usually outperform FFD-based heuristics and can sometimes reduce the number of bins used by up to ten percent. Further, in all cases where we were able to compute the optimal solution we found our new heuristics within few percent of optimal. We conclude that these new heuristics are an excellent alternative to FFD-based heuristics and are prime candidates to be used in practice.},

abstract = {The objective of this work is the development of a new finite element formulation for beams according to the Kirchhoff theory of thin rods, which includes the deformation states of axial tension, torsion and bending. The proposed formulation accounts for large deformations in three-dimensional problem settings consisting of slender, prismatic beams with arbitrarily curved initial geometries and arbitrary cross-section shapes. Like in geometrically exact Reissner theories the derived deformation measures are geometrically exact in the sense that they are consistent with the strong and weak form of the balance equations and the beam geometry for any configuration and for arbitrarily large translations, rotations and strains. A novel orthogonal interpolation strategy is applied to the triad field representing the cross-section orientation in order to fulfill the Kirchhoff constraint of vanishing shear strains in a strong sense and to preserve the objectivity of the spatially discretized problem. The continuity requirements resulting from the corresponding weak form are fulfilled by a cubic Hermite interpolation, thus leading to a C1-continuous representation of the beam centerline. Fundamental properties such as objectivity, path-independence, consistency and accuracy of the developed beam element are verified by means of suitable numerical examples.},

abstract = {Tensile fabric structures are used for large-scale iconic structures worldwide, yet analysis and design methodologies are not codified in most countries and there is limited design guidance available. Non-linear material behaviour, large strains and displacements and the use of membrane action to resist loads require a fundamentally different approach to structural analysis and design compared to conventional roof structures.The aim of the round robin analysis exercise presented here is to understand the current state of analysis practice for tensile fabric structures, and to assess the level of consistency and harmony in current practice. The exercise consists of four precisely defined tensile fabric structures, with participants required to carry out the form finding and load analysis of each structure and report key values of stress, deflection and reactions.The results show very high levels of variability in terms of stresses, displacements, reactions and material design strengths, and highlight the need for future work to harmonise analysis methods and provide validation and benchmarking for membrane analysis software. Greater consistency is required to give confidence in the analysis and design process, to enable third party checking to be carried out in a meaningful and efficient manner, to provide a harmonious approach for Eurocode development, and to enable the full potential of tensile structures to be realised. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Piecewise clothoids are 2D curves with continuous, piecewise linear curvature. Due to their smoothness properties, they have been extensively used in road design and robot path planning, as well as for the compact representation of hand-drawn curves. In this paper we present the Super-Clothoid model, a new mechanical model that for the first time allows for the computing of the dynamics of an elastic, inextensible piecewise clothoid. We first show that the kinematics of this model can be computed analytically depending on the Fresnel integrals, and precisely evaluated when required. Secondly, the discrete dynamics, naturally emerging from the Lagrange equations of motion, can be robustly and efficiently computed by performing and storing formal computations as far as possible, recoursing to numerical evaluation only when assembling the linear system to be solved at each time step. As a result, simulations turn out to be both interactive and stable, even for large displacements of the rod. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our model by handling various boundary conditions for the rod as well as complex external constraints such as frictional contact, and show that our model is perfectly adapted to inverse statics. Compared to lower-order models, the super-clothoid appears as a more natural and aesthetic primitive for bridging the gap between 2D geometric design and physics-based deformation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a system for simulating one dimensional flexible parts such as cables or hose. The modelling of bending and torsion follows the Cosserat model. For this purpose we use a generalized spring-mass system and describe its configuration by a carefully chosen set of coordinates. Gravity and contact forces as well as the forces responsible for length conservation are expressed in Cartesian coordinates. But bending and torsion effects can be dealt with more effectively by using quaternions to represent the orientation of the segments joining two neighbouring mass points. This augmented system allows an easy formulation of all interactions with the best appropriate coordinate type and yields a strongly banded Hessian matrix. An energy minimizing process accounts for a solution exempt from the oscillations that are typical of spring-mass systems. The whole system is numerically stable and can be solved at interactive frame rates. It is integrated in a virtual reality software for use in applications such as cable routing and assembly simulation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {gridshell is a structure that gains its strength and stiffness through its double curvature configuration. Its advantages are a minimum use of materials, structural efficiency and the creation of a large volume, as well as the potential for quick and cost-effective construction. However, few gridshells have been built due to a lack of knowledge and data. The process of creating the Downland Gridshell, as a specialist museum workshop completed in the spring of 2002, is a case study of successful collaboration and innovation in architecture, engineering and construction led by a multidisciplinary team of practitioners. This gridshell structure was composed of a double layer of mats comprising four layers of thin timber laths. These were harnessed together as a flat mat and then formed into a three-dimensional structure by a carefully orchestrated lowering of each supporting scaffolding prop, thereby harnessing gravity to pull the mat into shape. Many innovations are described in detail: team working, risk sharing, multidisciplinary design, structural modelling, the creation of new structural components, cladding, and construction processes including the sequence and techniques of gridshell forming. Advances made in this project have added to the knowledge of gridshell behaviour, construction and cost, thereby making the design and construction of future timber gridshells a more viable option.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical and numerical framework to compute bifurcations of equilibria and stability of slender elastic rods. The 3D kinematics of the rod is treated in a geo- metrically exact way by parameterizing the position of the centerline and making use of quaternions to represent the orientation of the material frame. The equilibrium equations and the stability of their solutions are derived from the mechanical energy which takes into account the contributions due to internal moments (bending and twist), external forces and torques. Our use of quaternions allows for the equilibrium equations to be written in a quadratic form and solved efficiently with an asymptotic numerical continuation method. This finite element perturbation method gives interactive access to semi-analytical equilibrium branches, in contrast with the individual solution points obtained from classical minimization or predictor–corrector techniques. By way of example, we apply our numerics to address the specific problem of a naturally curved and heavy rod under extreme twisting and perform a detailed comparison against our own precision model experiments of this system. Excellent quantitative agreement is found between experiments and simulations for the underlying 3D buckling instabilities and the characterization of the resulting complex configurations. We believe that our framework is a powerful alternative to other methods for the computation of nonlinear equilibrium 3D shapes of rods in practical scenarios. {\&}},

abstract = {We present an automatic approach for the reconstruction of parametric 3D building models from indoor point clouds. While recently developed methods in this domain focus on mere local surface reconstructions which enable e.g. efficient visualization, our approach aims for a volumetric, parametric building model that additionally incorporates contextual information such as global wall connectivity. In contrast to pure surface reconstructions, our representation thereby allows more comprehensive use: first, it enables efficient high-level editing operations in terms of e.g. wall removal or room reshaping which always result in a topologically consistent representation. Second, it enables easy taking of measurements like e.g. determining wall thickness or room areas. These properties render our reconstruction method especially beneficial to architects or engineers for planning renovation or retrofitting. Following the idea of previous approaches, the reconstruction task is cast as a labeling problem which is solved by an energy minimization. This global optimization approach allows for the reconstruction of wall elements shared between rooms while simultaneously maintaining plausible connectivity between all wall elements. An automatic prior segmentation of the point clouds into rooms and outside area filters large-scale outliers and yields priors for the definition of labeling costs for the energy minimization. The reconstructed model is further enriched by detected doors and windows. We demonstrate the applicability and reconstruction power of our new approach on a variety of complex real-world datasets requiring little or no parameter adjustment.},

abstract = {Because of their original organic shape and the column free space that they provide, the design of grid shell structures challenges architects and structural engineers in more than one way. Very few grid shell building exist around the world. This scarcity may be explained by the level of innovation required in such fields as design technique; construction scheme, use of material... The goal of this paper is to unify the design work done on grid shells, to understand the evolution of the designs and to provide the reader with a sense of what awaits grid shell structures in the future. The construction of a timber grid shell starts from a flat, two dimensional wooden net, the three dimensional shell type structure is then achieved by pushing on the edges of this mat and gradually releasing the internal stresses at the joints to enable the shape to live and the structure to take its most adequate form. Only three wooden grid-shell structures exist world wide, by studying the way they work and behave, as well as the process that lead to the choice of such a structure, we'll understand how grid shell were born in the mind of architects and structural engineers.(cont.) Even if the mechanism of grid shells is a very clever and well thought system, as wood remains a lively material, it can be subjected to degradation and deformation which as a result will damage the structure and attend to its integrity. Timber construction is also limited in terms of load carrying capacity. As grid shells have become more popular new solutions have been developed in terms of choice of material. Steel has already replaced timber in large span glass grid shell and the use of composite materials to benefit of the original construction scheme of timber grid shell is currently being investigated.},

The parametrization of the cross-section rotation tensor is based on the composition of a torsional rotation and the so-called smallest rotation to the tangent vector of the beam axis, as proposed in Boyer and Primault (2004). The novel aspects of the proposed model are the following: (i) closed-form expressions for the variations of the strain measures are presented and the equilibrium equations and their linearization are completely written in terms of the independent kinematic parameters, (ii) torsion-warping is allowed, as well as Wagner effects, and (iii) arbitrary cross-sections are considered, namely cross-sections where the shear centre and centroid do not coincide. Moreover, several fundamental aspects related to the cross-section rotation parametrization are discussed. The accuracy and the computational efficiency of the finite element implementation of the proposed model is demonstrated in several numerical examples.},

abstract = {In the pursuit of performance-based architecture there is an increased demand for integration between engineers and architects, between analysis and design. The key to make wise choices early in a design process, has previously been based on experience from prior work and experiments with physical models. With modern computational power those choices can be supplemented with real-time feedback from analysis tools. But few programs are designed for the type of light weight, real-time analysis that can be useful in the exploration of an architectural concept. This has been the target for a research and development team, SMART Solutions, at Buro Happold. SMART Form is a tool for performance-based architecture as a plug-in for the 3D modeling software Rhinoceros. It combines analysis and rationalization of complex geometries with form finding and sculpting of structures, driven by a dynamic relaxation solver. The plugin transforms the 3D modeling software to a virtual physical environment, influenced by various forces and a gravitational field. It enables sketching and sculpting of efficient compression (shells and gridshells) and tension structures (cable nets and membranes). The purpose for the thesis has been to advance SMART Form by implementing beam elements and explore how bending action can be used in the form finding process, allowing for a compromise between initial geometry and fully form found geometry. Automatic sizing of the beam elements is also implemented as a method to evaluate form. The thesis leads to an investigation of how to conduct conceptual structural design, and how this process can potentially be approached differently with the means of real-time feedback from analysis, form finding and sizing. In order to allow for real-time analysis an iterative technique called dynamic relaxation is used as the computational solver. As a result of the exploration of form finding with bending action a method called Limit control form finding was developed. This method enables form optimization of the most critical parts of a structure by specifying a limit for the bending capability of the elements. It was found to work in a good way for 2D structures but sometimes resulting in a less appealing, wrinkled looking grids for 3D structures. Dynamic relaxation is found to be a suitable method for real time analysis, although with some important issues regarding speed. The number of iterations needed to reach convergence is concluded to depend on the relation between local and global stiffness for each node in the structure. Hence the method works efficiently for some types of structural configuration (for example gridshells with a locally weak direction), while a conventional matrix solver would perhaps be more suitable for other cases (for example space truss structures). The implemented functionality, such as form finding using cables, limit control and automatic sizing is demonstrated with a couple of test cases. One of which is the Exeter gridshell roof where engineers at Buro Happold have been involved from the concept design to the realized structure. The real design process for the project is shown and new approach based on real time feedback is demonstrated. With the new functionality implemented during the thesis, SMART Form has become a much more sophisticated tool, and a great improvement for the design process of the Exeter roof could be made. Due to the possibilities of a quick and efficient collaborative design process, that comes with the new tool, it seems to offer great potential in bridging between engineers and architects in structural concept design.

abstract = {In this work, we suggest a locking-free geometrically exact finite element formulation incorporating the modes of axial tension, torsion and bending of thin Kirchhoff beams with arbitrary initial curvatures. The proposed formulation has been designed in order to represent general load cases and three-dimensional problem settings in the geometrically nonlinear regime of large deformations. From this comprehensive theory, we not only derive a general beam model but also several reduced formulations, which deliver accurate solutions for special problem classes concerning the beam geometry and the external loads. The advantages of these reduced models arise for example in terms of simplified finite element formulations, less degrees of freedom per element and consequently a higher computational efficiency of the corresponding numerical models. A second core topic of this publication is the treatment of membrane locking, which is a locking phenomenon predominantly occurring in highly slender curved structures, thus, exactly in the prime field of application for Kirchhoff theories. In order to address the membrane locking effect, we will propose a new interpolation strategy for the axial strain field and compare this method with common approaches such as Assumed Natural Strains (ANS) or reduced integration. The effectiveness of this method as well as the consistency and accuracy of the general finite element formulation and the reduced beam models will be illustrated with selected numerical examples.},

The aim of this article is to compare the structural performance of two kind of gridshells. The first one is the kagome gridshell and it is derived from a non-regular pattern constituted of triangles and hexagons. The second one results from a regular pattern of quadrangles unbraced by diagonal elements. A method is proposed to cover kagome gridshells with planar facets, which reduces considerably the cost of fabrication of the cladding. The sensitivity of kagome gridshells to geometrical imperfections is discussed. The linearised buckling load of kagome gridshells is then compared to the one of quadrilateral gridshells. The most relevant design variables are considered in the parametric study. Two building typologies are studied for symmetrical and non-symmetrical load cases: dome and barrel vault. It reveals that the kagome gridshell outperforms quadrilateral gridshell for a very similar construction cost.},

abstract = {An orthonormal frame (f1,f2,f3) is rotation-minimizing with respect to fi if its angular velocity ?? satisfies ????fi???0 - or, equivalently, the derivatives of fj and fk are both parallel to fi. The Frenet frame (t,p,b) along a space curve is rotation-minimizing with respect to the principal normal p, and in recent years adapted frames that are rotation-minimizing with respect to the tangent t have attracted much interest. This study is concerned with rotation-minimizing osculating frames (f,g,b) incorporating the binormal b, and osculating-plane vectors f, g that have no rotation about b. These frame vectors may be defined through a rotation of t, p by an angle equal to minus the integral of curvature with respect to arc length. In aeronautical terms, the rotation-minimizing osculating frame (RMOF) specifies yaw-free rigid-body motion along a curved path. For polynomial space curves possessing rational Frenet frames, the existence of rational RMOFs is investigated, and it is found that they must be of degree 7 at least. The RMOF is also employed to construct a novel type of ruled surface, with the property that its tangent planes coincide with the osculating planes of a given space curve, and its rulings exhibit the least possible rate of rotation consistent with this constraint. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Curves are widely used in computer science to describe real-life objects such as slender deformable structures. Using only 3 parameters per element, piecewise helices offer an interesting and compact way of representing digital curves. In this paper, we present a robust and fast algorithm to approximate B{\'{e}}zier curves with G1 piecewise helices. Our approximation algorithm takes a B{\'{e}}zier spline as input along with an integer N and returns a piecewise helix with N elements that closely approximates the input curve. The key idea of our method is to take N+1 evenly distributed points along the curve, together with their tangents, and interpolate these tangents with helices by slightly relaxing the points. Building on previous work, we generalize the proof for Ghosh's co-helicity condition, which serves us to guarantee the correctness of our algorithm in the general case. Finally, we demonstrate both the efficiency and robustness of our method by successfully applying it to various datasets of increasing complexity, ranging from synthetic curves created by an artist to automatic image-based reconstructions of real data such as hair, heart muscular fibers or magnetic field lines of a star. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Dias2014,
abstract = {We consider the equilibrium shapes of a thin, annular strip cut out in an elastic sheet. When a central fold is formed by creasing beyond the elastic limit, the strip has been observed to buckle out-of-plane. Starting from the theory of elastic plates, we derive a Kirchhoff rod model for the folded strip. A non-linear effective constitutive law incorporating the underlying geometrical constraints is derived, in which the angle the ridge appears as an internal degree of freedom. By contrast with traditional thin-walled beam models, this constitutive law captures large, non-rigid deformations of the cross-sections, including finite variations of the dihedral angle at the ridge. Using this effective rod theory, we identify a buckling instability that produces the out-of-plane configurations of the folded strip, and show that the strip behaves as an elastic ring having one frozen mode of curvature. In addition, we point out two novel buckling patterns: one where the centerline remains planar and the ridge angle is modulated; another one where the bending deformation is localized. These patterns are observed experimentally, explained based on stability analyses, and reproduced in simulations of the post-buckled configurations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The algorithm uses an adaptive stencil which allows it to construct an approximation free of oscillations near discontinuities in the function or its derivatives.

To demonstrate the accuracy and capability of this nonlinear beam element, nonlinear static and dynamic analysis of two highly flexible beams are performed, including the twisting a circular ring into three small rings and the spinup of a flexible helicopter rotor blade (Graphical abstract). These numerical results reveal that the proposed nonlinear beam element is accurate and versatile for modeling, analysis and 3D rendering and animation of multibody systems with highly flexible beam components. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Dynamic relaxation (DR) has been widely used as a powerful method for structural analysis and form-finding. Compared with the direct stiffness method, one advantage of DR is that there is no need to compose a global stiffness matrix; for DR, every node of the structure can be seen as a single particle constrained by forces generated by the interactive mechanism of the structural members. The equations of motion for particles are much easier to consider than the direct stiffness approach, especially when structures undergo large displacements and rotations. However, most applications of DR are restricted in the field of cable, membrane, hanging chain structures. The common feature behind these structures is that only three degree of freedom (3- DOF) nodes are used. And for 3-DOF nodes, no bending moment but translational forces can be applied. In this paper, we propose the rotation formulations for DR. The description of motion of one particle is then separated into two parts, the translational and the rotational. Therefore, additional rotation degree of freedom is introduced into the computation system and we can use DR to simulate structure systems composed of 6-DOF nodes. We further show how we apply the 6-DOF DR, with the beam mechanism, to the simulation of framed structures. Validity is examined through examples of structures which undergo large displacements},

This article shows how composite materials can be an original and profitable solution for such constructions. In the first section, the authors recall the principal characteristics of gridshells. They explain then why glass fibres reinforced polymers provide a very attractive solution for this kind of application. The second section is dedicated to the numerical modelling of the structure. The basic principles of the dynamic relaxation method are presented. The third section shows the results of the measures taken on the prototype built at the Navier Institute and compares them with the results of the numerical simulations. A fourth section deals with the roofing solutions of such structures, and shows scale: 1 realisation. Finally the authors conclude on the potential of such structures for larger span constructions.},

@article{Liew2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.Dynamic relaxation is an analysis method that can be used to find the static equilibrium state of a structure undergoing large displacements. Due to the algorithm's iterative nature, which derives from a damped dynamic oscillations approach, it can take considerable time when solving models with dense node counts. This research looks at a vectorised dynamic relaxation implementation, executed on a graphics card's processing unit (GPU) for the most computationally demanding calculations, and compared to traditional computations on the central processing unit (CPU), to determine if time savings can be found with the change in processor type. The programming language Python and module PyCUDA are utilised on a desktop graphics card with over two thousand shader cores, and compared to a quad-core processor using the same code layout. A vectorised formulation for bar elements and reduced degree-of-freedom beam elements is used, to analyse the absolute and relative run-times for three benchmark cases. It is found that for models with low node counts, the CPU is faster, while for medium to highly dense models, the GPU acceleration can reduce absolute run-times by a factor of three to just over eight. Most benefit is gained when the executed code allows the GPU cores to be overloaded, such that complex calculations involving large arrays of data can be spread over the many cores. This was evident in the GPU load demand, which increased steadily with increasing node count but remained below 100{\%}, while the CPU was readily activated to maximum load for even simple models. The time savings are of interest to architects, engineers and researchers utilising the dynamic relaxation method with medium to complex models, as the benefits can be harnessed with minimal code alteration.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new erection technique for post-formed timber gridshells based on an inflatable membrane technology. All well-known gridshell construction techniques are either based on the pulling/pushing up a flat grid of laths, or on the easing down of a grid of quads from a certain height. These techniques already suffer from shortcomings at the small scale; when applied to the large scale, the lack of a standardised and cost-effective erection method implies that new techniques have to be thought up each time. This is one of the reasons why gridshells are have only been designed for exceptional projects, such as the Downland Museum or the Mannheim Multihalle. Gridshells are not widely applied to common projects, even though they enable large spans to be covered with the minimum amount of material, they are fast to construct and are entirely recyclable. In this work, an inflatable membrane has been designed and used to erect a gridshell prototype with a footprint of 55m2. Inspiration comes from the work of the architect Dante Bini, who, since 1964, has been realising hundreds of inflatable concrete domes around the world},

abstract = {Applications in which composite materials are used as bearing structural elements are rare and generally copy structural solutions that have been optimized for steel for years. Unfortunately these materials have very different properties, therefore specific construction methods and specific structural forms have to be invented for composite materials. Gridshell structures may be one of those. So, after a brief history of gridshells, a demonstration with the Ashby's method that glass fibre reinforced polymers are an alternative for this kind of structure is shown. An original experimental test for the identification of the parameters of the short and long time behaviours of bent pultruded tubes is then detailed. Afterwards a scale one prototype of composite gridshell is presented and loaded. Results of the experimental tests are compared to numerical results of a non-linear analysis done with the dynamic relaxation method. The authors then concluded on the feasibility of such composite gridshells and on their potential for future development. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper reports the architectural and engineering design, and construction, of The Faraday Pavilion, a GFRP elastic gridshell with an irregular grid topology. Gridshell structures are self-formed through an erection process in which they are elastically deformed, and the prediction and steering of this aspect becomes a central part of both architectural and engineering design processes. While there are existing architectural approaches to determining the geometry of other kinds of form-active structure, as well as new engineering approaches to the simulation of bending active structures, a fast and light-weight design approach to bending active structures is not currently developed. In this paper, we introduce an approach to the architectural design of a bending active structure whereby the shell form and grid topology are determined by simulation. Particular features are that the grid topology is not pre-described, but rather emerges as part of the simulation, and that different calculative models relating to the material, element and structural scales are solved and synthesized by extending the technique of dynamic relaxation. Secondly, the results of this design modelling are provided as the input for a quantitative engineering simulation, where the equilibrium shape and load-bearing capacity of the elastically-bent structure is calculated with a non-linear, three-dimensional finite element model within the FEM-package Sofistik. We compare the advantages and disadvantages of both methods, which while complementary have important differences relating to the interaction with the design of the structure, differences in the definition of supports, connections and elements, the speed of calculation and the magnitude and precision of the results.},

abstract = {Bending-active structures are composed of curved beam or shell elements which base their geometry on the elastic deformation of an initially straight or planar configuration. In bending-active structures the moment of inertia has a direct influence on the residual stress and is therefore limited by a given minimal curvature in the system and the permissible bending stress capacities of the chosen material. These interdependencies may lead to a scaling issue that limit bending-active structures to a certain size range. This range may be widened if the system's reliance on elastic stiffness is compensated by other stiffening factors such as coupling of structural elements and stress stiffening effects. This paper will analyse the scaling effects in bending-active structures. Some basic systems are studied by means of dimensional analysis and FEM parameter studies to clarify at which power each influencing factor effects scaling. Based on these findings some more complex structures are studied for their scalability. This will offer the basis for some more general conclusions.},

abstract = {The equations for the equilibrium of a thin elastic ribbon are derived by adapting the classical theory of thin elastic rods. Previously established ribbon models are extended to handle geodesic curvature, natural out-of-plane curvature, and a variable width. Both the case of a finite width (Wunderlich's model) and the limit of small width (Sadowksky's model) are recovered. The ribbon is assumed to remain developable as it deforms, and the direction of the generatrices is used as an internal variable. Internal constraints expressing inextensibility are identified. The equilibrium of the ribbon is found to be governed by an equation of equilibrium for the internal variable involving its second-gradient, by the classical Kirchhoff equations for thin rods, and by specific, thin-rod-like constitutive laws; this extends the results of Starostin and van der Heijden (2007) to a general ribbon model. Our equations are applicable in particular to ribbons having geodesic curvature, such as an annulus cut out in a piece of paper. Other examples of application are discussed. By making use of a material frame rather than the Fr$\backslash$'enet-Serret's frame, the present work unifies the description of thin ribbons and thin rods.},

In this paper, we present CORDE(french 'rope'), a novel deformation model for the dynamic interactive simulation of elastic rods with torsion. We derive continuous energies for a dynamically deforming rod based on the Cosserat theory of elastic rods. We then discretize the rod and compute energies per element by employing finite element methods. Thus, the global dynamic behavior is independent of the discretization. The dynamic evolution of the rod is obtained by numerical integration of the resulting Lagrange equations of motion. We further show how this system of equations can be decoupled and efficiently solved. Since the centerline of the rod is explicitly represented, the deformation model allows for accurate contact and self-contact handling. Thus, we can reproduce many important looping phenomena. Further, a broad variety of different materials can be simulated at interactive rates. Experiments underline the physical plausibility of our deformation model.},

The designer inputs a sequence of control points, and the computer fits a smooth curve that goes through these points. The literature of interpolating splines is rich, much of it based on the mathematical idealization of a thin elastic strip constrained to pass through the points. Until now there is little consensus on which, if any, of these splines is ideal. This thesis explores the properties of an ideal interpolating spline. The most important property is fairness, a property often in tension with locality, meaning that perturbations to the input points do not affect sections of the curve at a distance. The idealized elastic strip has two serious problems. A sequence of co-circular input points results in a curve deviating from a circular arc. For some other inputs, no solution (with finite extent) exists at all.},

Yet this unique fluidity is seldom capitalised on, with concrete instead being cast into rigid prismatic moulds to create high material use structures with large carbon footprints. This paper will demonstrate how replacing conventional orthogonal moulds with a flexible system comprised primarily of high strength, low cost fabric sheets, can utilise the fluidity of concrete to create extraordinary possibilities for highly optimised, architecturally interesting, building forms.},

abstract = {Cosserat nets are networks of elastic rods that are linked by elastic joints. They allow to represent a large variety of objects such as elastic rings, coarse nets, or truss structures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model and dynamically simulate such Cosserat nets. We first derive the static equilibrium of the elastic rod model that supports both bending and twisting deformation modes. We further propose a dynamic model that allows for the efficient simulation of elastic rods. We then focus on the simulation of the Cosserat nets by extending the elastic rod deformation model to branched and looped topologies. To round out the discussion, we evaluate our deformation model. By comparing our deformation model to a reference model, we illustrate both the physical plausibility and the conceptual advantages of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Thin elastic filaments in real world such as vine tendrils, hair ringlets or curled ribbons often depict a very smooth, curved shape that low-order rod models — e.g., segment-based rods — fail to reproduce accurately and compactly. In this paper, we push for- ward the investigation of high-order models for thin, inextensible elastic rods by building the dynamics of a G2-continuous piecewise 3D clothoid: a smooth space curve with piecewise affine curvature. With the aim of precisely integrating the rod kinematic problem, for which no closed-form solution exists, we introduce a dedicated integration scheme based on power series expansions. It turns out that our algorithm reaches machine precision orders of magnitude faster compared to classical numerical integrators. This property, nicely preserved under simple algebraic and differential operations, allows us to compute all spatial terms of the rod kinematics and dynamics in both an efficient and accurate way. Combined with a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme, our method leads to the effi- cient and robust simulation of arbitrary curly filaments that exhibit rich, visually pleasing configurations and motion. Our approach was successfully applied to generate various scenarios such as the unwinding of a curled ribbon as well as the aesthetic animation of spiral-like hair or the fascinating growth of twining plants.

However, most systems of ordinary differential equations are too complicated to be integrated exactly. Therefore, mathematicians have developed ways through which we can ap- proximate such systems. These numerical integrators solve systems of differ- ential equations to within a certain error. The complexity and cost of such integrators grows with their precision. Numerical analysts are always looking for new integration schemes that have low error and low cost.

abstract = {We present algorithms for simulating and visualizing the insertion and steering of needles through deformable tissues for surgical training and planning. Needle insertion is an essential component of many clinical procedures such as biopsies, injections, neurosurgery, and brachytherapy cancer treatment. The success of these procedures depends on accurate guidance of the needle tip to a clinical target while avoiding vital tissues. Needle insertion deforms body tissues, making accurate placement difficult. Our interactive needle insertion simulator models the coupling between a steerable needle and deformable tissue. We introduce (1) a novel algorithm for local remeshing that quickly enforces the conformity of a tetrahedral mesh to a curvilinear needle path, enabling accurate computation of contact forces, (2) an efficient method for coupling a 3D finite element simulation with a 1D inextensible rod with stick-slip friction, and (3) optimizations that reduce the computation time for physically based simulations. We can realistically and interactively simulate needle insertion into a prostate mesh of 13,375 tetrahedra and 2,763 vertices at a 25 Hz frame rate on an 8-core 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon PC. The simulation models prostate brachytherapy with needles of varying stiffness, steering needles around obstacles, and supports motion planning for robotic needle insertion. We evaluate the accuracy of the simulation by comparing against real-world experiments in which flexible, steerable needles were inserted into gel tissue phantoms.},

Published by the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures (IASS) with permission. The aim of this paper is to present some innovative strategies for the design of plated shell structures. Fabrication constraints are carefully considered, as the obtained shapes are covered with planar quadrilateral facets only. Different corrugation strategies are investigated, and our method guarantees extension of the shape generation to complex topologies. Few parameters control the amplitude of corrugations, which also gives us the opportunity to perform a sensitivity analysis on the influence of corrugations on the structural performance of folded-plate structures. The study focuses on the influence of the mechanical attachment between plates on the overall structural performance as well as fabrication rationality.},

Following Samelson and Dayawansa, we look at Chebyshev nets given by a dual curve, splitting the surface into two connected half-surfaces, and a distribution of angles along it. An analogue to the Hazzidakis' formula is used to control the angles of the net on each half-surface with the integral of the Gaussian curvature of this half-surface and the Cauchy boundary conditions. We can then prove the main result using a theorem about splitting the Gaussian curvature with a geodesic, obtained by Bonk and Lang.},

The architecture's novel features are the representation of an artifact with distinct levels of idealization, a hierarchy of classification within each of these levels, and the appropriate separation of software components. These enable seamless integration of geometric modeling and structural analysis in an interactive environment, extensibility of modeling and analysis capabilities, and integration of interactive multi-objective optimization. The paper presents a design environment implemented on the basis of the architecture, and demonstrates the benefits of refocusing engineering software from analysis to design. ??2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A discrete formulation of elastic rod has been tailored for the particular design task of geometric modelling, form finding and analysis of actively bent structural systems. The rod element is fully described by using vector based quantities, hence making it easy to implement and be suitable for explicit resolution methods such as the Dynamic Relaxation (DR). From this point of view, the model under consideration aims to provide a natural enhancement, of existing DR schemes of elastic rods, primarily formulated for analysis/design of stressed spline structures with isotropic cross-section, whilst, the proposed formulation allows for the general case of initially straight rods with anisotropic cross-section and torsional stiffness effects, to be taken into consideration. In order to avoid numerical conditioning problems, the method adopts a reduced Degrees of Freedom approach, however, the design limitations usually involved with such an approach, are ‘removed' by adopting the Bishop theory of framed curves, hence making it possible to reduce to only three (translations) the Degrees of Freedom to be explicitly computed by numerical integration of the corresponding acceleration terms.},
