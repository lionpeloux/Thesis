Introduction

\blockcquote[][p.~250]{IL10}{At present, the architectural significance of grid shells can hardly be fully envisioned. Too little experience has been gained as yet. However, the first signs of a grid shell architecture are already apparent. The projects planned and executed to date and the results of this research work indicate possibilities that open up a wide field of applications for grid shells. Two things stand out above all. The first is the nearly unlimited variety of forms that can be realized with grid shells, the second is the fact that there is no closed shell surface, but rather a simple, spatially curved grid composed of rods. Both features are of fundamental significance. They fully characterize the architectural essence of the grid shell support structure.}
